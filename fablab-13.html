* Join one of the introduction sessions.
* Elect a group leader.
* Document hands-on exercise with available interface examples.
* Optionally discuss an additional example that you have used in the past or wish to explore.

Individual assignment
* Link to the group assignment page.
* Describe what you learned from the group assignment on your documentation page briefly.
* Write an application that interfaces a user with an input and/or output device that you made.
* Include a hero video and source files of the application in your documentation.</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-kxioer">Group</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-i7hnr2">Group assignment this week was handled by Miro Keimiöniemi (link pending)</p> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-z7urna">Concept</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1vuoxka">The agenda for this week was to set up the initial working version of the debug app for my final project, <a href="fablab-00">the gloves</a>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-lv9v89">I chose the Rust based <a href="https://bevyengine.org/" rel="nofollow">Bevy game engine</a> for this project. Using it feels more like using a framework than an engine, really, since there’s no standalone editor or other executable that you run to make things. Instead, you add it as a dependency like any other crate in your project. If using a game engine sounds like overkill for a simple app, you can pick and choose only the features your project needs, making it potentially quite lightweight.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ftk1zm">To use this engine, you of course would need Rust installed on your machine. I’m using the <a href="https://rustup.rs/" rel="nofollow">Rustup</a> tool to manage Rust installations.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-mtmm8d">Then you would be best served by following along with the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/" rel="nofollow">Bevy book</a>. Create a rust project, add Bevy as a dependency, and then add Bevy’s recommended optimisations to the cargo.toml file. It’s all explained in the book.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-cyysea">I’ve used Bevy before, but never anything async or with networking. Those aspects would be new to me and useful for my future projects using the engine.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ge8jc">For the code going into the ESP32, I first thought I’d be following the tutorials mentioned in the <a href="fablab-12">previous assignment post</a>. The ESP32 was going to be here, at first, an <a href="https://dev.to/apollolabsbin/embedded-rust-bluetooth-on-esp-ble-server-1no8" rel="nofollow">unsecure BLE server.</a>. There were however some compiler issues that I was unable to solve at first. So in the interest of time I opted for <a href="https://github.com/bjoernQ/bleps" rel="nofollow">Bleps</a>, which I did manage to get working sooner.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-wwxbvg">For the code going into the Bevy app, I need two things. First, a library to handle connecting to bluetooth devices. The one I found and got working was <a href="https://github.com/deviceplug/btleplug" rel="nofollow">btleplug</a>. Since that crate seemed to heavily use async, I also needed <a href="https://github.com/EkardNT/bevy-tokio-tasks/tree/master" rel="nofollow">bevy-tokio-tasks</a> to provide better async support for Bevy. That crate was somewhat old but it was relatively trivial to update to work with the latest version of Bevy.</p> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-18meajt">Process</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-bwhlq2">There was a lot of frustration while getting these things to work. I didn’t document all the struggles with the compiler, as there’s way too many individual stumbling blocks there to effectively list here. Things to do with choosing the correct compilation targets, reconciling incompatible dependencies between examples found online etc. Instead I’ll start with the debugging I did with the bluetooth connection, and then the multiplexer. Final working code will be appended at the end of this post once it is, well, working.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1s4d19d">BLE</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1d72qdo">BLE = Bluetooth Low Energy.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-hn33mf">Once the Bevy app and embedded program were up, I tried getting them to connect to each other. Eventually, it was successful, and I was able to send some hard-coded messages from the ESP32 to the Bevy app via bluetooth.</p> <img src="fab13/01.png" alt="successful data send"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-be1lxd">The connection was highly unreliable, and I didn’t know why. There were issues with timeouts and local connection aborts that I didn’t know how to debug. So let’s attempt to make sense of some of them.</p> <pre class="language-undefined"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-undefined">Starting scan on hci0 (usb:v1D6Bp0246d0540)...
Peripheral &quot;Ruka&quot; is connected: false

Error connecting to peripheral, skipping: Service discovery timed out</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1iqn70s">Service discovery timed out.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-18ky0p3">(WIP)</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-83alt0">MUX</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-p24qjg">This was the first time I tried programming the <a href="fablab-10">input board</a>. I was behind on that assignment and getting the physical board finished, so I didn’t have time to test it until this week. And as it turned out, there were issues with the multiplexer.</p> <img src="fab13/02.jpg" alt="DIY debug setup"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-r05s2j">I wasn’t at the lab when I encountered all these issues</p> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-1ae1dy5">Code</h1> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-1b4cfnx">ESP32</h2> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-3xpkxq">Bevy</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1lsorsu">I will show screenshots of the app and then the final working code at the end.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1dgm0bl">I wanted to learn how to use the [Bevy Hanabi] GPU particle plugin, so I started my project from their portal example.</p> <img src="fab13/s01.png" alt="Bevy Hanabi example"></article> </div>
