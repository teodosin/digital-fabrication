Our direct instruction was on the other machine, the SRM-20, but we were assured that the wiki would have all the necessary information. That turned out to be the case, for the most part.

The lab was out of tool #1, so in it’s stead we were to use #3. I assumed we were also to replace #1 with #3 in all the settings. This was not the case. Leaving tool #1 in the relevant settings allowed the contours to get generated like they were supposed to.",ft,S,Yt,ct,T,$t="I luckily didn’t have serious further issues with the actual milling.
