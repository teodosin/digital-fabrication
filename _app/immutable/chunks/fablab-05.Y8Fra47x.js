* Do NOT use Formlabs printers. This assignment is only FDM.
* Join one of the scheduled introduction / TA sessions to complete the group assignment and get booking access to printers.
* The FDM 3D printers are booked for you until end of next week.

Group assignment

* Join FDM 3D Printing introduction session and document as you go.
* After the introduction session each of you should print one design rule test file (angle, free, bridging, combined) using any of the FDM 3D printers.
* Look at the prints together and discuss what can you learn from them in terms of design rules.
* Each group has a group leader who is responsible for creating the group assignment page.
* Each participant from the group should link to that page from their individual documentation.

Individual assignment

* Design an object (a small one, few cm3) that CAN NOT be made using subtractive manufacturing.
* 3D print the object you designed using an FDM printer, such as Ultimaker, Prusa MK4 or Prusa MINI.
* 3D scan anything with one of our Creality Ferret 3D Scanners.</code>`,pt,g,oe="Group",ht,d,fe='Our <a href="https://celeste_sanja.gitlab.io/digital-fabrication/group_assignment.html" rel="nofollow">group assigment page</a> this week was created by Celeste Smareglia.',ct,v,me="Design",gt,_,pe="I wanted to do something non-technical for a change.
