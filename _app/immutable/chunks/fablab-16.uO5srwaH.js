         What will it do?
         Who&#39;s done what beforehand?
         What will you design?
         What materials and components will be used?
         Where will come from?
         How much will they cost?
         What parts and systems will be made?
         What processes will be used?
         What questions need to be answered?
         How will it be evaluated?
* Make sure that...
      Your project should incorporate 2D and 3D design,
         additive and subtractive fabrication processes,
         electronics design and production,
         embedded microcontroller interfacing and programming,
         system integration and packaging
      Where possible, you should make rather than buy
         the parts of your project
      Projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual 
         mastery of the skills, and be independently operable </code>`,G,d,re='A big picture reflection on the <a href="fablab-00">Glove Controller final project</a>.',R,f,he="Overview",U,m,pe="My final project is a single glove for the right hand that would measure movement, rotation and flexion of the fingers in real time, and transmit that data over Bluetooth to a PC.

Originally the plan was to create a pair of gloves, but the scope had to be reduced from this due to time constraints.",E,v,ue="The intended use-case is for creative applications. Digital sculpting, painting, and general navigation and manipulation of 3D space were the aspirational applications for the gloves.
