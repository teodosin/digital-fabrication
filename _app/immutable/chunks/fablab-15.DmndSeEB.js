To make it more specific locally, work towards the action items below.

* Draw a system diagram of your final project.
* Create a 3D design of how major components are going to fit together in your final project.
* Calculate power budget of your system and decide what power supply it will need and where it is going to enter the system.
* Decide what connectors you will use and how you will cut cables to size.
* Draw a cable management diagram.
* Decide what components will be made and what will be ready-made.</code>`,L,c,st="Diagram",S,p,nt,z,w,ot="I was unsure of how detailed this diagram was meant to be.
