* Join one of the test equipment introduction session.
* Use the test equipment (benchtop power supply, oscilloscope, logic analyzer) at the Fablab to observe the operation of a microcontroller circuit board.
* Check operating voltage on the board with multimeter or voltmeter.
* Elect a group leader who will be responsible for creating group assignment page.
* Help group leader with adding relevant information to the group assignment page.

Individual assignment

* Add link to the group assignment to your documentation page along with a paragraph of text about what you learned.
* Design and make a circuit board using KiCad or equivalent electronics design automation (EDA) software. 
* You can use XIAO, ATtiny, D11C microcontrollers as core components.
* As a minimum, add a LED, a button and a 2x2 connector for serial communication with other boards that you will make in following weeks.
* Break out all the unused pins of the microcontroller you are using as the core.
* Calculate the ideal value of a current limiting resistor for the LED you are using on your board. </code>`,p,r,y="KiCad";return{c(){i=u("h3"),i.textContent=_,m=f(),o=u("ul"),o.innerHTML=w,h=f(),l=u("h1"),l.textContent=x,d=f(),s=u("pre"),g=new D(!1),p=f(),r=u("h1"),r.textContent=y,this.h()},l(e){i=c(e,"H3",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),b(i)!=="svelte-sbwzft"&&(i.textContent=_),m=v(e),o=c(e,"UL",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),b(o)!=="svelte-1v95jb0"&&(o.innerHTML=w),h=v(e),l=c(e,"H1",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),b(l)!=="svelte-g9rspt"&&(l.textContent=x),d=v(e),s=c(e,"PRE",{class:!0});var t=E(s);g=T(t,!1),t.forEach(a),p=v(e),r=c(e,"H1",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),b(r)!=="svelte-1urbi"&&(r.textContent=y),this.h()},h(){g.a=null,L(s,"class","language-undefined")},m(e,t){n(e,i,t),n(e,m,t),n(e,o,t),n(e,h,t),n(e,l,t),n(e,d,t),n(e,s,t),g.m(k,s),n(e,p,t),n(e,r,t)},p:C,i:C,o:C,d(e){e&&(a(i),a(m),a(o),a(h),a(l),a(d),a(s),a(p),a(r))}}}const I={title:"Electronics Design",date:"2024-03-20",description:"The eighth assignment for the Digital Fabrication minor.",categories:["projects"],tags:["digital-fabrication"],cover:"fab4/14.jpg"};class M extends j{constructor(i){super(),q(this,i,null,F,A,{})}}export{M as default,I as metadata};
