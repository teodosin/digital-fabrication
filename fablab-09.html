* Add an output device to a microcontroller board you&#39;ve designed, and program it to do something. 
* If you have not produced and tested a board in the Electronics Design week yet, you can improve its design to include an output device and produce one working board for both of the weeks (Electronics Design and Output Devices).
* Include a hero shot and source files of your board in your documentation (such as KiCad project and Arduino test code). 
* Submit a link to your assignment page here.</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-z7urna">Concept</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-m72mgf">I had an idea for a project that I wasn’t sure if I had time to finish. It could probably be a final project by itself, since getting it to actually work as intended would undoubtedly take multiple iterations of trial and error. But I might as well make the board needed for it.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-14x1lm5">The concept is a card scanner. It could take in a card from a deck of cards, photograph it, flip it over, photograph again, then spit it out the other end. The setup would need a camera and preferably two motors. With some clever gear mechanisms all the motions could maybe be done with a single motor, but I decided to play it space. Trade in some mechanical complexity for circuit complexity.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-24aqva">So two motor drivers and an <strong>ESP32S3</strong> microcontroller, which has a camera module available.</p> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-1urbi">KiCad</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1e3fnfb">I followed the lecture recording to get started and made two copies of essentially the same circuit for the two motors. It was quite a bit more complex than the previous boards, so I didn’t manage to build a full understanding of what was going on. <strong>Capacitors</strong> are there to deal with voltage fluctuations, and <strong>potentiometers</strong> are there to split the incoming voltage.</p> <img src="fab9/01.png"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-cxjg9g">I knew that for my use case I wasn’t going to need a whole lot of power for the motors, so I explored the option of drawing power to them directly from the ESP32. It had a 5V power output, and using it would mean that I could power the whole device just with the usb port to the ESP32.</p> <img src="fab9/04.jpg"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-4f3xdf">I tested running a motor directly from the ESP32 and it worked. I also tested placing a small piece of thin plywood onto the end of the motor (forgot to take a photo of it though) to get some intuition about how much force the motor could exert. It was plenty enough for my (hypothetical) use-case.</p> <img src="fab9/02.png"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-u0nzen">Routing the two sets of motor components was tricky. It took quite a few attempts and switching around of pins to get everything connected. I read somewhere online that connecting all ground pins to the surrounding copper board like we did during <a href="fablab-08">electronics design week</a> wasn’t actually best practice. I couldn’t confirm or deny that at that point, so I made the effort to actually route the ground pins, just in case.</p> <img src="fab9/03.png"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1hzo47b">One leg of the droid done. In my mind, the board would be sitting vertically on a wall of the enclosure in which the photos would be taken, so the ESP32 and its connected camera would be mounted on the top of the enclosure, and the motors would be below it, spinning the wheels that move the cards and operating the flipper that turns them over.</p> <img src="fab9/05.png"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-13bgr9m">Routing was mostly done by this point. Added the heatsinks for each motor driver still.</p> <img src="fab9/06.png"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1nyqt55">The design rules checker alerted me to some insufficient clearance issues with the board edge cut and the heatsinks. Moving them a bit further fixed the issues and left behind only the silkscreen warnings, which I presumed could still be safely ignored.</p> <img src="fab9/07.png"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-x5f9n">Then I noticed I had forgotten the mounting holes.</p> <img src="fab9/08.png"> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-10znkaw">Milling</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1m0wqwb">This was my most painful milling experience at this point. It took over three hours to get a board that looked passable.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1942iis">The first attempt produced routes that were too thin. I had set the depth of the engraving too deep, trying to avoid the multiple milling passes I had to do with the previous board. Ended up ruining the plate, and I had to prepare another. No images of the first one.</p> <img src="fab9/08.jpg"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1jj45n0">The second attempt was uneven; half of the board was milled properly, and the other half was too shallow and didn’t cut away all the copper. You can tell from the shininess.</p> <img src="fab9/09.jpg"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1aroppg">I had taped the board in two parts, and milled exactly above the gap between the tapes. Clearly, the two tapes had lifted the board to different heights. Also I didn’t think to properly clean the machine bed after my first attempt, so the dust could also have contributed to the problem. This wasn’t something that could be fixed with a new milling pass, so I had to start over again.</p> <img src="fab9/10.jpg"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-vvu7l6">With the third plate I set the engraving depth more conservatively and accepted that I might have to do multiple passes. And I did end up doing multiple, because the plate was again uneven, though less than before. After the last one, there was only copper left in one corner, and I scraped that out with just a knife. Made me think whether the previous attempt could also have been salvaged manually.</p> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-rlms3v">Soldering</h1> <img src="fab9/11.jpg"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1naqe3k">Components were gathered, and I only then realised that I needed rivets for the screw terminals. They ended up causing most of the problems in the soldering process.</p> <img src="fab9/12.jpg"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-3szajt">I inserted the rivets from the back of the board, planning to put solder only there after inserting the screw terminals. I thought that on the opposing side, the rivets would have had more surface area to connect to the board.</p> <img src="fab9/13.jpg"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-8zcwvv">I tried testing the rivets’ conductivity, and at that point they seemed fine. I proceeded with soldering the rest of the components.</p> <img src="fab9/14.jpg"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-11htq4u">The motor drivers were somewhat challenging. The exposed pad was recommended to be soldered with solder paste and a hot airgun. It took multiple attempts on both drivers, but eventually I managed to keep the paste liquid enough and pressed hard enough that the solder joints were formed.</p> <img src="fab9/15.jpg"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-6xw6lu">Soldering the rest of the pins was actually very enjoyable. I made mistakes multiple times, connecting the pads accidentally to the surrounding copper, but managed to fix each with the desoldering band.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-19k8e1b">The screw terminals, however, weren’t connecting properly. I had to really press with the multimeter to get a signal. I was overconfident and had soldered the terminals on tightly, and needed help getting them out. I hammered in the rivets again until I was certain they were in. And then, I only put the screw terminals in at the very ends, so I could have space later to put more solder on if necessary.</p> <img src="fab9/16.jpeg"> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-gvjxay">Testing</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-6yxuy">(haven’t had time to do this yet)</p></article> </div>
