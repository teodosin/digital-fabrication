# Assignment

```
Group assignment

* Join one of the test equipment introduction session.
* Use the test equipment (benchtop power supply, oscilloscope, logic analyzer) at the Fablab to observe the operation of a microcontroller circuit board.
* Check operating voltage on the board with multimeter or voltmeter.
* Elect a group leader who will be responsible for creating group assignment page.
* Help group leader with adding relevant information to the group assignment page.

Individual assignment

* Add link to the group assignment to your documentation page along with a paragraph of text about what you learned.
* Design and make a circuit board using KiCad or equivalent electronics design automation (EDA) software. 
* You can use XIAO, ATtiny, D11C microcontrollers as core components.
* As a minimum, add a LED, a button and a 2x2 connector for serial communication with other boards that you will make in following weeks.
* Break out all the unused pins of the microcontroller you are using as the core.
* Calculate the ideal value of a current limiting resistor for the LED you are using on your board.
