# Group

Group assignment this week was handled by Miro Keimi√∂niemi (link pending)

# Concept

The agenda for this week was to set up the initial working version of the debug app for my final project, [the gloves](fablab-00).

I chose the Rust based [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/) for this project. Using it feels more like using a framework than an engine, really, since there's no standalone editor or other executable that you run to make things. Instead, you add it as a dependency like any other crate in your project. If using a game engine sounds like overkill for a simple app, you can pick and choose only the features your project needs, making it potentially quite lightweight.
