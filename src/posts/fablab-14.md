# Assignment

```
This week you will explore a digital manufacturing technology beyond the capability of a basic fab lab.

Design and produce something with a digital process (incorporating computer-aided design and manufacturing) not covered in another assignment, documenting the requirements that your assignment meets, and including everything necessary to reproduce it.

Choose one of the proposed digital manufacturing technologies.
Create a digital design to be manufactured with the technology/machine of your choice.
Work together with the workshop master and document the process.
Publish the documentation on your course documentation page.
Submit a link to your documentation page here.
```

My choice was waterjet. 

# Design

For the design, I chose a personal logo/monogram I made in the first year of my studies during a typography course. 

![first year monogram](fab14/01.png)

Its features and proportions were somewhat small for a logo, which should in principle be legible on a small scale. 

![recreation](fab14/02.png)

A quick recreation to improve on the original design.

It felt naive though. Didn't look quite right. 

![from typography](fab14/03.png)

I took the time to start again, but properly, starting from polished typographical elements. I found a decently pretty serif font and created a V and a T with strokes on them, placed them on top of each other and used the shape builder in Inkscape to explore some possible combinations. I can recommend this workflow; the shape builder is quick and intuitive to work with.

A few iterations in, there was a winner. 

# Waterjet

I wasn't the one operating the machine, but I followed along closely. 

The material I got was two sheets of "mild steel" from the metal workshop scraps. In other words, not stainless. A problem for future me.

Prepping the .dxf in the software.

Filling up the waterjet tank with water. The water level was first raised to just below the surface area.

Placing the first steel sheet on the waterjet. The cutting area is narrower than what it might look like, so it's preferable to position the material closer to the center of it.

The machine first gets calibrated via "homing", where the nozzle is moved to each end of the cutting area. Then the origin (called "home" b the software for some reason) for the cut job gets set.

These clamps get placed on opposite edges of the material to keep it pressed down in place.

![](fab14/07.jpg)

The water level gets raised to just above the surface of the material, touching the nozzle. This makes the cutting much quieter than it would've otherwise been. This of course impacts visibility into what's going on.

Machine getting started.

First visible cutting marks. 

![](fab14/10.jpg)

After the lower part, the "V" was cut, we made sure that the wider "T" wasn't about to go past the edges of the material. All good. 

![](fab14/11.jpg)

First one finished. 

![](fab14/12.jpg)

I also got to cut out a second one, this time a bit larger but out of thinner steel.

The smaller finished monogram.

Both side by side. 

I was recommended to treat the steel in one of two different ways afterward, to prevent rusting. One was a process called "bluing" which apparently involved heating up the steel to a certain temperature. The other was polishing it and then coating it with spray paint.
