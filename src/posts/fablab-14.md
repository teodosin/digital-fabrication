# Assignment

```
This week you will explore a digital manufacturing technology beyond the capability of a basic fab lab.

Design and produce something with a digital process (incorporating computer-aided design and manufacturing) not covered in another assignment, documenting the requirements that your assignment meets, and including everything necessary to reproduce it.

Choose one of the proposed digital manufacturing technologies.
Create a digital design to be manufactured with the technology/machine of your choice.
Work together with the workshop master and document the process.
Publish the documentation on your course documentation page.
Submit a link to your documentation page here.
```

My choice was waterjet. 

# Design

For the design, I chose a personal logo/monogram I made in the first year of my studies during a typography course.

Its features and proportions were somewhat small for a logo, which should in principle be legible on a small scale. 

![recreation](fab14/02.png)

A quick recreation to improve on the original design.

It felt naive though. Didn't look quite right. 

![from typography](fab14/03.png)

I took the time to start again, but properly, starting from polished typographical elements. I found a decently pretty serif font and created a V and a T with strokes on them, placed them on top of each other and used the shape builder in Inkscape to explore some possible combinations. I can recommend this workflow; the shape builder is quick and intuitive to work with.

A few iterations in, there was a winner.
