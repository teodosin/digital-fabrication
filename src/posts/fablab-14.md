# Assignment

```
This week you will explore a digital manufacturing technology beyond the capability of a basic fab lab.

Design and produce something with a digital process (incorporating computer-aided design and manufacturing) not covered in another assignment, documenting the requirements that your assignment meets, and including everything necessary to reproduce it.

Choose one of the proposed digital manufacturing technologies.
Create a digital design to be manufactured with the technology/machine of your choice.
Work together with the workshop master and document the process.
Publish the documentation on your course documentation page.
Submit a link to your documentation page here.
