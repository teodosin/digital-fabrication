I'm Viktor. Almost done with my master's in Visual Communication Design. Trying to make the most of my last semester by learning Digital Fabrication. 

I briefly studied programming before my current studies and have since been self-taught. I enjoy making tools, either by code for digital art or by woodworking for traditional art. I'd love to be able to make electronic devices and merge digital and physical workflows in more interesting ways.
