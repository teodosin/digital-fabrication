Here was the assignment:</p> <pre class="language-undefined"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-undefined">* Complete laser cutter introduction and safety training and document the process in a group assignment page. One person from each group will be responsible for creating the group documentation repository/page.
* Add link to your the group documentation page/repository to your individual documentation. 
* Design, laser cut a parametric press-fit kit. Please avoid making boxes with finger joints. It is going to be considered below minimum requirements. Material (cardboard, ~3.75mm thick) is provided. Material thickness should be a parameter for on-site adjustment.
* Use the vinyl cutter to cut something. It can be as simple as a sticker for your laptop to multi-color design for your t-shirt.</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-zefshb">Idea</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ph3fz8">I thought of those cool old globes where the stand was bulky and wrapped around the entire sphere at its waist. You know, one of <em>these</em>:</p> <img src="fab3/00_globe.jpg" alt="Photo by Adolfo Félix  on Unsplash" class="cap"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-16v53s3">I’ve always liked these better than the slim modern globes. There’s just something about them that draws the eye.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1o0235e">But what if the globe could be rotated freely, and what if it was swappable? What if, instead of a map of the Earth, a globe was blank and could just be drawn on? To create a fictional planet for worldbuilding, whether it be for a story or a custom board game. Or just art for the sake of it, in an unusual format.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1epaw98">So the project would be the stand for globes. The globes themselves would be created separately. The design I came up with seemed doable for a first laser cutting project.</p> <img src="fab3/01_sketch1.jpg" alt="First and second sketch of the stand"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-5o5u6n">On the right, the first sketch. On the left, the second.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-pusdp7">The legs of it would attach to the rim and to each other at the bottom. I took on the challenge of making six legs instead of four, because I thought it would look nicer that way.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ztirj8">The design could theoretically accomocate spheres of different scales. There would be adjustable supports with smooth ends at the bottom and the edges of the stand, which the spheres would rest on. The smaller the sphere, the longer the supports. The sphere would always rest in the centre and be able to be rotated smoothly.</p> <img src="fab3/02_sketch2.jpg" alt="Profile sketch of the design"> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-1rb93f2">CAD</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1q6mlux">My first instinct was just going directly into Inkscape and trying to measure out all the different pieces there. Then I remembered an important detail in the assignment:</p> <pre class="language-undefined"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-undefined">Material thickness should be a parameter for on-site adjustment.</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-fehdz">I needed to learn parametric modeling in order to satisfy this requirement. I had no idea how to do this, but luckily found a fitting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGba5Sv3G3Q" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> for the exact type of connection I needed in my project. I learned its name then, too. <strong>Tabs and Slots</strong>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-5sohyr">Still using <a href="https://www.ondsel.com" rel="nofollow">Ondsel</a> for the CAD modeling. It’s just a UX wrapper for <a href="https://www.freecad.org" rel="nofollow">FreeCAD</a>, so the same tutorials apply.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-iyp24">The first step, in a new project, was to create a spreadsheet in the spreadsheet workbench to store the variables. I created a cell with</p> <img src="fab3/04_spreadsheet.png" alt="Creating a spreadsheet in Ondsel"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-tp90gd">To connect the variable cell with the actual value, an <strong>alias</strong> is needed. This is done by right-clicking the value cell and going into its <strong>Properties</strong> and simply setting the alias to be the same as the variable name. Also we specify the display unit to be millimeters.</p> <img src="fab3/05_alias.png" alt="Creating an alias"> <img src="fab3/06_unit.png" alt="Setting the display unit"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1kfhofi">Then it was time to create the outline sketches. At this point I did move to Inkscape for a bit to decide on a rough shape for the legs. And more importantly, I had to make sure that the measurements I was thinking of could actually fit on the cardboard sheet that we were to be given.</p> <img src="fab3/07_leg_svg.png" alt="Vector design for the legs"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-in895">The leg doesn’t reach the centre because many of them will have to fit around in a circle. Shortening it in that direction would also help with fitting the legs more easily on the flat sheet that I was cutting from. I wanted an outer circumference of <strong>400mm</strong> for the rim so I could fit a 300mm circumference sphere at best. The design also requires 12 leg cutouts. It was a lot to fit on a single sheet.</p> <img src="fab3/09_layout.png" alt="Test layout in vector"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-xdp92e">I was told the sheet was roughly 600mm by 900mm. Seems to fit quite nicely. The rest of the parts are much smaller, so they should be trivial to fit.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ogz5dy">Now I could return to the sketching of the leg.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ms48bq">I created three more variables/aliases with the following values:</p> <ul data-svelte-h="svelte-1s3fv3z"><li>tab_length - 20.0mm</li> <li>lap_depth - 20.0mm</li> <li>centre_radius - 40.0mm</li></ul> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1dyatls">In case they might need to be changed later.</p> <img src="fab3/10_constraints.png" alt="The fully constrained sketch of the leg"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1vxfef2">This was when the sketching process finally clicked for me. My workflow was as follows:</p> <ul data-svelte-h="svelte-tpgigk"><li>Place all the primitives the sketch will consist of such as arcs, lines, polylines and b-splines. They don’t need to be perfect or even connected</li> <li>Delete all default constraints! I presumed I needed to have fine control over how the sketch was constrained in order for changes in my variables to nicely update the model. Starting from scratch would allow me that freedom.</li> <li>Add the dimension constraints that refer to variables.</li> <li>Add the rest of the constraints. There’s an uncountable amount of combinations of constraints that could brind degrees of freedom down to zero. I found this to be a highly enjoyable creative exercise.</li></ul> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-yvcp7t">When creating a “dimension” constraint you are prompted to enter a length into a text box. There is a button in it that allows you to enter an expression. Referring first to the spreadsheet and then to a variable within allows for the constraint to reference that variable.</p> <img src="fab3/11_length.png" alt="length"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1bh5wbe">Changing a value in the spreadsheet must be followed up with a manual recompute of the sketch, which confused me at first.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1tyntt6">I did several things next:</p> <ul data-svelte-h="svelte-17hbmq3"><li>Added a pad to the leg with the value of material_thickness</li> <li>Created a new variable/alias called <strong>leg_gap</strong> with a value of 10mm</li> <li>Set the <strong>Attachment Offset</strong> on the leg sketch to refer to leg_gap</li> <li>Used the <strong>Draft Workbench</strong> to <strong>Mirror</strong> the leg to the other side of the plane it was on</li> <li>Used the <strong>Polar Array</strong> Tool in that same workbench on both the leg and its mirror to create 6 copies around the origin</li></ul> <img src="fab3/12_array.png" alt="Array"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1mtizc1">And there we go. Looking pretty good already.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-v6r90u">Next were the slots on the top rim. They had to be placed programmatically in the appropriate spots, because adjusting the leg_gap would offset their positions. Luckily again, this is precisely what the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ6bao8-nn4" rel="nofollow">second part of the earlier tutorial</a> went into.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-371e29">I went in to edit the sketch of the rim circle. I created two rectangles over two adjacent tabs.</p> <img src="fab3/13_slotches.png" alt="Two rectangles over tabs"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1k15swi">I then used the <strong>Polar Transform</strong> tool to copy the rectangles over to all the other tabs as well. You can see the settings I used in the screenshot below.</p> <img src="fab3/14_polar.png" alt="Polar transform"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-18pz5or">I went back out of the sketch and I made sure to <strong>select the rim body</strong> which the sketch was in <strong>from the tree view by double-clicking</strong> . I then selected the tops of all the tabs on all the legs and created a <strong>Sub-Shape Binder</strong> from them. The binder was created inside the rim body because it was the currently active body.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1qj5i1s">Then I hid all the legs and went back in to the rim’s sketch. I needed to access the binder from the sketch by using the <strong>External Reference</strong> tool in the Sketcher workbend. This took a few tries to get working. I made sure to have rim body active, and both the sketch and the binder selected so that there was a check-mark next to them in the tree view. Then the missing piece was going to the correct view, because apparently the binder is only visible from one side of the sketch. Finally, with the External Reference tool I selected two opposing edges from each binder rectangle, which made their points selectable in the sketching process. I went through every single pair of points and constrained them to each other.</p> <img src="fab3/16_extref.png" alt="Constraining Points to External Reference"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-19uadxh">Ah, fully constrained.</p> <img src="fab3/17_constd.png" alt="Fully constrained rim"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-7hb0s5">While troubleshooting the external references earlier I also came across the <strong>Dependency Graph</strong> feature in Ondsel. While it didn’t help me this time, it seemed like a very useful tool to get a more detailed overview of the structure of everything. It is found in the <strong>Tools-menu</strong>.</p> <img src="fab3/18_graph.png" alt="Dependency Graph"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1pn7rcf">The two circles connecting the legs together were next. I created a new body for the bottom one, and with it active, created a <strong>datum plane</strong> from the bottom side of one of the bottom laps. I made a sketch with just a circle in it, and I set the circle’s radius to be <code>circle_radius + lap_depth * 2</code>. Referring to two of the variables in my spreadsheet. Then again a padding with <code>material_thickness</code>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-15y7xms"><img src="fab3/19_bot_plane.png" alt="Bottom circle">.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-hiqelk">Using the same workflow as before to cut out the laps in the circle seemed tedious to me. I wanted to see if I could use <strong>boolean operations</strong> to directly cut out the correct holes with the legs.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-rz9eq4">In the <strong>Part</strong> workbench, there are boolean operations available. With the one of the Arrays and the circle selected (and the datum plane deleted because it was causing issues for some reason), it kind of worked…</p> <img src="fab3/20_bool.png" alt="First boolean attempt"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-3w463e">The legs disappeared.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-pp1hku">I did it for the second array as well.</p> <img src="fab3/21_bool2.png" alt="Second boolean"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1semgqj">Perfect. But where did the legs go?</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-m9wqcl">Turns out they were only hidden. Selecting them in the tree view and hitting <strong>space</strong> brought them back again.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-15dlm3w">For the second circle plane, I went into the <strong>Draft Workbench</strong> and used <strong>Clone</strong>, the tool with the silliest looking icon in the whole program. Offset the position on the Z-axis with <code>material_thickness + plane_gap</code>, the latter being a new variable I created to constrain the edge between the two circles in the leg sketch. I went back to it to set the constraint.</p> <img src="fab3/22_clone.png" alt="Cloned"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-xnlbe5">Cool.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-i2bwn3">If you remember, the plan was to have adjustable supports coming inward from the tops of all the legs. At this point I still wasn’t sure what they were going to look like and how they were going to be attached, but I trusted that if there was a bit of a supporting structure around the spots where they were going to be attached, there would be a way.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-18gaej8">I considered duplicating the entire rim, but then that would take up a ton of space on the cutting sheet. So I ended up just making small shelves in inside the legs just below the rim.</p> <img src="fab3/23_shelves.png" alt="Shelves"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-4wqkk9">That mostly completed the design.</p> <img src="fab3/24_complete.png" alt="Mostly complete design"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-yyb7et">In the Draft workbench, <strong>Shape2DViews</strong> were created for each unique shape in the design. These would then be exported into an svg file.</p> <img src="fab3/25_shape2d.png" alt="Shape2Ds"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1098v2m">In Inkscape, I copied over the shapes to have the correct amounts, in a similar layout as I was testing out much earlier. I was also happy to notice that the Shape2DView’s were reactive to when I changed the material thickness in the spreadsheet, so I could just re-export them as svg’s with different thicknesses, since I intended to eventually cut this out of plywood.</p> <img src="fab3/26_sheet.png" alt="Final Layout"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-pl0kwx">There was one more issue I ran into while trying to offset the paths to account for the kerf of the laser. All paths were disconnected from each other by default when exporting from Ondsel. But the <a href="https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/76534/automatically-merge-overlapping-nodes-in-inkscape" rel="nofollow">solution</a> was soon found.</p> <pre class="language-undefined"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code class="language-undefined">* Ungroup (Shift-Ctrl-G) your objects, select the paths and combine (Ctrl-K) them in a single path

* Switch to Edit paths by nodes mode (F2), select all the nodes and join selected nodes (Shift-J).

* When all the nodes are selected, the join selected nodes function applies to all the couples of endnodes found.

* If the coordinates of your nodes overlaps perfectly, this should work (you don&#39;t need to repeat your step 2. thousands of times).</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1331qm6">Now the paths were correctly joined and the offset worked correctly. In Inkscape you may find it in the Paths Menu among the various Path Effects. Set to 0,19mm to offset by half of the kerf.</p> <img src="fab3/27_fx.png" alt="Path Effects"> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-kxioer">Group</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-kin04g">The documentation for our group introduction to the laser cutter can be found here:</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-3vd97j"><a href="https://mikajarvi.gitlab.io/digital-fabrication/laser-cutting.html" rel="nofollow">https://mikajarvi.gitlab.io/digital-fabrication/laser-cutting.html</a></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1nj33o">Credit and cheers to Mika Järvi.</p> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-sqokns">Cardboard</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-d0xaod">The day after the safety training, I arrived at the fablab to use the laser cutter.</p> <img src="fab3/28_cutprep.jpg" alt="Prepping the cut"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-toi28l">I went through the steps and was pleased to notice that I could fit two of my sets onto one sheet of cardboard. So I had a backup in case something failed. And it almost did.</p> <img src="fab3/29_cut.jpg" alt="Cutting the thing"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1cx9cat">On the first pass some settings were off by a bit, and the laser didn’t cut all the way through. I redid the same job with slighly lower power, unsure about how second passes such as this should be done. I also saw thin strands of smoke coming from a couple spots during the pass, so going over it a second time made me nervous.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1qcjv29">The second pass went smoothly though, and it did cut through that time. Mostly. There was a clear difference in the cutting strength the farther you got from the top-left corner, which we were warned about, but I was still surprised it was that much. The bottom pieces I had to snap out, but luckily nothing ripped.</p> <img src="fab3/30_pcs.jpg" alt="Pieces"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-16v1c6x">Assembly was harder than expected. The slots were a tight fit, and I’m still not sure what exactly was off. I think the cardboard was just thicker on average than the parts that were measured. I could have overestimated the kerf too.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1t36mz9">I noticed that because of the inner structure of the cardboard, not all tabs and slots were created equal. This was most clear on the legs that were rotated on the sheet. The top tab was structurally firm on the legs that were vertical, but the rotated ones had less of the inner material in them and more easily collapsed.</p> <img src="fab3/31_dir.jpg" alt="Upright and rotated legs' top tabs side by side"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-v427iy">It wasn’t a dealbreaker though. Most connections were sound enough that the overall assembly went well.</p> <img src="fab3/32_topless.jpg" alt="Topless"> <img src="fab3/33_done.jpg" alt="Finished cardboard model"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-6qp22w">I was quite happy with the result.</p> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-c5ad2w">Plywood</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-15d3w4f">I still wanted to make the thing properly, with plywood. So I could screw or glue the supports in and actually use it for its intended purpose.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-sa2v96">It would use quite a bit of wood though. I needed to prepare test shapes which I could cut from scraps before committing to cutting the complete set.</p> <img src="fab3/34_test.png" alt="Test pieces for plywood cutting"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-dnci60">The plywood I was going to use was 3mm in thickness. How the test pieces fit together would determine whether I would use my 3.0mm vector file for cutting or the 3.1mm one.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-as8jc1">But that was independent of the kerf. I still needed to calculate the kerf with the material and cutting settings that I was going to be using. So I cut 5 squares to do the measurement and to determine the correct laser settings.</p> <img src="fab3/35_sqr.jpg" alt="lots of failed squares"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-134s1jk">Fifth time’s the charm. The first attempt I forgot to set the autofocus and all the following attempts I spent fiddling with the power and speed settings. I also was cutting the test squares at the furthest spot from the top-left that I knew my larger sheet was going to go to. Just to properly simulate the power loss that would later occur.</p> <img src="fab3/36.jpg" alt="squares"> <img src="fab3/37.jpg" alt="a"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-qsxctg">The kerf turned out to less than I expected. Only 0.12mm. A 0.06 offset in the vector files would suffice.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-12g8pdd">I cut out the test pieces from the earlier file and tested how the parts snap together. It actually turned out that the 3.1mm tabs were snapping into place much better than the exact 3.0 equivalents,</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-6f7ft">It was time to start cutting. The job was to last a whopping 38 minutes.</p> <img src="fab3/38.jpg" alt="a"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1dydgw9">So far so good. It is good to see the cut pieces fall a bit from their enclosure.</p> <img src="fab3/39.jpg" alt="a"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ijer0p">When the job was finished, there was an immediate issue. The laser cutter has a “safe area” in addition to just the region marked by the vector paths. When I moved my design in the laser cut prepping program, I must have moved it just barely past the edge of the safe area. So the bottoms of the last four legs weren’t cut out.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-151do95">I returned to the vector file and deleted everything except the missing parts of the legs plus a small buffer. I tried to place the new paths just by eyeing it with the camera. When I ran the cutting job, it was off by a couple millimeters. It took two more tries to get it right. The first leg from the left suffered a bit from the ends, but survived.</p> <img src="fab3/40.jpg" alt="a"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-z09msu">Then, despite the cutting tests earlier, not all of the pieces were cleanly cut. Quite a few of the legs were still stuck to the surrounding wood by a surprising amount. Likely the wood was thicker on those points. I couldn’t think of another reason.</p> <img src="fab3/42_hex.jpg" alt="a"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1t8d55i">Just for fun, I cut out a bunch of hexagons from the wood that was left. Also a small gift for a friend whose birthday it was on this day.</p> <img src="fab3/43.jpg" alt="a"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1csupm5">Tokens or tiles for a board game?</p> <img src="fab3/41.jpg" alt="a"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-pbnsts">The pieces that were still stuck to the board were easy enough to cut out with an exacto knife. During assembly, I was so relieved to find that the parts were clicking nicely into place. Some needed a bit of hammering though.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1kf8ufe">And here, the final cardboard and plywood models side by side.</p> <img src="fab3/44.jpg" alt="a"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-x2ns7g">The supports and the actual globe of the project will come later, on my own time. At the time of writing this I’m about to order a couple styrofoam spheres for this. Still need to figure out a nice solution for the supports.</p> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-xrloiq">Vinyl</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-z3doeh">The final part of the assignment was to get familiar with the lab’s vinyl cutter.</p> <img src="fab3/45.jpg" alt="a"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-31uyq4">I originally thought I was going to print a sticker design and then cut that out with the cutter. I was reminded that the assignment was to just cut <em>something</em>, and not to get too involved with it. Just cut something.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1qp04bd">I had the design ready though. I wanted to try to cut it out.</p> <img src="fab3/46.jpg" alt="a"> <img src="fab3/47.jpg" alt="a"> <img src="fab3/48.jpg" alt="a"> <img src="fab3/49.jpg" alt="a"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-nzibtm">As expected, some details were way too small to be nicely cut. It wasn’t too bad though; with some adjustment to the design, it could be turned into a decent sticker.</p> <img src="fab3/50.jpg" alt="a"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1w3odtd">I salvaged a little bit and stuck it to my old laptop. Toothless grin.</p> <img src="fab3/51.jpg" alt="a"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-honeir">And for completeness’ sake:</p> <img src="fab3/52.jpg" alt="a"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-af1cbn">Kinda neat.</p></article> </div>
